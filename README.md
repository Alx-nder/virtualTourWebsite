FOLDERS:
        
    API's: 
    This folder contains scripts that implement a  decentraland API and a Zoom API. 
        1. The decentraland API is used to get meta-data on NFT parcels for sale and also a link to enter the MetaVerse at that parcel.
        2. The Zoom API is used to create a zoom meeting so that several persons can explore a space at once but more importantly, so realtors/tech support can communicate with users at any time.
    
    chatbot_module: 
    This folder contains the cource code for the chatbot used on the web app. the chatbot is powered using the chatterbot module. The chatbot is implemented with AJAX in the chatbot.js that sends requests and responses to and from the chatbot1.py script.

        N.B. speech_module.py is script that uses voice recognition to send a request to the chat bot. That is to say, the user can speak into a mic then speech_module.py turns the speech into text then that text is sent to the chatbot.

    This folder contains the current MySQL database.
